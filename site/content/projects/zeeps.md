  Zeeps was my final assessment during my third year whereby we were challenged to create an entrepreneurial proposal for 6-12 marketable products. Our task what to fulfill the following:


  * Come up with an initial idea for a product, whether it be physical or digital, that can be marketed and sold.

  * Create a brand statement that outlines the purpose of the business, demographic and goal of the product/business. 

  * Design the branding (logo, website, any promotional items, etc.)

  * Seek a manufacturer/service to produce the product professionally. 
  
  * Market a campaign that ties the product in with an existing charity to help raise funds and spread awareness of said charity.


  My product was Zeeps! 100% upcycled carry solutions with the intent of creating something new out of something old and abandoned. Zeeps uses materials found at second hand shops to both provide funds for the underprivileged and create one of a kind designs based on what's available at the time. The designs are calculated and intended to make carrying certain items easier and more attainable. They are sewn by local seamstresses. All tags and labels have been locally sourced and produced. Specifically, the labels are a stamp I had laser engraved at a local printer, which was also used to create sealed labels on the cases themselves.


  The charity I chose to partner up with was Lighthouse Australia, as they battle child homelessness in Australia. I felt that tied in really nicely with my product/business' background. I created a promotional site that linked from Zeeps' main page via a splash screen. There you could purchase t-shirts, ribbons, badges, stickers and the you could even donate directly to the foundation.


  This assessment was certainly a challenge at first, but was extremely fun and rewarding after the initial hurdle. Despite my only having any real hands-on creativity, being mostly a digital artist, it was certainly eye opening at how much goes into creating and manufacturing a physical product in small quantities.
