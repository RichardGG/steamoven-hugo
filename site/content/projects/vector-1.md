  My love for vector illustration, and Adobe Illustrator, began with my use of
  the software during my first year of university. I have worked hard to learn
  the ins and outs of the software since.


  Although I mainly make these illustrations in my spare time, I like to utilise
  vectors within my layout designs as I feel they add another dimension to the
  overall project and can be quite effective where implemented well.
