  I was asked to help out with a billboard campaign St. Stephen's College wanted
  to implement along Hope Island Rd on the Gold Coast.


  Working alongside the Marketing Manager, we came up with our "main" design
  (first image). The second part of the campaign was to create print
  advertisements for the local newspaper.


  Due to initial unforeseen delays, I was asked to complete the first round of
  the project in less than three days. Collaborating heavily with the Marketing
  Manager, we were successful! The artwork was up for over a month (which can be
  seen in the last image).

  After my contract with Gold Coast City Marina had concluded, I took on a
  position as the Griffith University Student Guild Graphic Designer to help
  with their internal clubs’ design, as well as helping with GUGC marketing
  collateral. Pictured are the two trivia night event posters I created during
  my time with GUGC, which were distributed around campus and shared via social
  media.


  During this time, I was also involved with the Design Institute of Australia
  (DIA) Queensland branch as a volunteer designer and committee member. I was
  asked to come up with a design for their 2016 DIAlogues event titled, ‘The
  Good, The Bad and The Ugly’ which was based around the good, bad and downright
  ugly side of design and architecture on the Gold Coast. My design showcases a
  spin on the title and includes a colour palette that represents the Gold Coast
  (sun, surf and sand). It was printed and distributed around the Gold
  Coast/Brisbane as a foldable poster/flyer. As the event was approaching, I
  made matching name tags to be distributed to the members and honoured guests
  that would be attending the event.
