  My work relationship with Gold Coast City Marina & Shipyard began as an
  internship six months before I was due to graduate. My major task, alongside
  an experienced marketing executive, was to create a 70\+ page, annual Marina
  magazine that showcases articles related to boating, fishing and general
  marina life. From scratch, we completed the project in two months and had
  thousands of copies printed for distribution locally and globally. [Click here

  The magazine wasnâ€™t my only task, as I was given other projects during this
  time, which spanned from creating flyers, informative pamphlets and signage to
  creating advertisements for the other tenants of the marina.


  Post internship, I was later taken in for a casual position where I was given
  the task of branding the new restaurant, Quarterdeck, opening next door to the
  main administration building at the marina. My first creation was the logo,
  which is still in use, and is located on the storefront, uniforms, print media
  and web/social media. I also designed the initial menus, packaging stickers,
  gift cards and more.
