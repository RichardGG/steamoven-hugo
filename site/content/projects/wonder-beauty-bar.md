description: >-
  An ex-colleague of mine from Mail Boxes Etc. left for bigger and better
  things: she opened up her own beauty salon!


  Naturally, I offered to assist with the graphic design, and these are the
  outcome.




  Chrissy provided me with a clear brief for the design: simple, yet effective,
  specifically with Futura font, with dark pink and peach tones. She likes to
  keep it minimal, refraining from heavy image use throughout branding and
  advertising. Chrissy relies on Instagram heavily for advertising, networking
  and conversing with clients and other beauticians alike, so it’s important
  that people know her handle.
