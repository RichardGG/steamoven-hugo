  After my contract with Gold Coast City Marina has concluded, I took on a
  position as the Griffith University Student Guild graphic designer to help
  with their internal clubs’ design, as well as helping with some of their
  events. Pictured are the two trivia night event posters I created during my
  time with the student guild, which were distributed around campus and on their
  social media pages.


  During this time, I was also involved with the Design Institute of Australia
  (DIA) Queensland branch as a volunteer designer and committee member. I was
  asked to come up with a design for their 2016 DIAlogues event titled, ‘The
  Good, The Bad and The Ugly’ which was based around the good, bad and downright
  ugly side of design and architecture on the Gold Coast. My design showcases a
  spin on the title and includes a colour palette that represents the Gold Coast
  (sun, surf and sand). It was printed and distributed around the Gold
  Coast/Brisbane as a foldable poster/flyer. As the event was approaching, I
  made matching name tags to be distributed to the members and honoured guests
  that would be attending the event.
