  I started the project by researching similar designs at the time, and experimenting with different fonts, colours and textures before starting on my own design. After the research stage, I went out and found an existing tea box (in this case, I used Lipton) as a template. I converted my flattened paper template into a digital file that I used in Adobe Illustrator to draw out the designs I had concocted.


  My tea designs were created to break the usual expectation of boring tea packaging; I wanted the packaging to speak for itself, to catch and bemuse the consumer when they enter the tea aisle in search for their perfect cuppa.


  For this process I used Adobe Illustrator, InDesign to create my designs. They were then printed on 300GSM double-sided paper (the other side of which included a pattern that would be seen when the box opened). I hand cut the templates and glued them together to form the completed Tea Time boxes.


  Although Tea Time was one of my earlier University projects, it stands to be one of the more creative outcomes Iâ€™ve produced. I regard it as one of my most thought out and calculated projects to date and hope to work more within product packaging in the future.
