  I was contacted by the marketing executive I worked with on the Marina
  Magazine, as Sage Apartments were in urgent need of a brochure that would
  showcase the benefits of purchasing an apartment with Sage. The brochure was
  done on a very tight deadline, but was printed no more than a week and a half
  after starting the project. The final brochure's printed outcome included a UV
  coating for that final, sophisticated finish.


  The second print project is a DL flyer, which will be used to garner interest
  from a potential buyer through a real estate agent. The agent can attach their
  own card to the DL flyer which the client can take home with them. It includes
  all of the important information concerning Sage Apartments and showcases a
  relaxing and modern atmosphere through the chosen photographs.
